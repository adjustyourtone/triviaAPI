10/8 
- Project did not work unless I removed all version dependencies from the requirements.txt file. Specifically Psycopg2-binary and Werkzeug were producing errors at the desired version


-Needed to alter trivia.psql to reflect a new Owner: postgres (my DB username).

10/10
- Compelted Get questions and Delete questions.
  - delete throws an error upon confirmation, but the change still persists in the DB. It is supposed to call getQuestions() on success, but there are no parameters passed, maybe I can fix this error by updating.

10/13 
-added pointer to Links for better UX (Header.css)
- FormView.js was throwing error - Category type needed to be added to form.
- Created search query. Needed to change url in QuestionView.js
