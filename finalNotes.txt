To Project Reviewer:

This project took much longer than I thought it would because I wasn't terribly familiar with ReactJS so I needed to learn a bit. A couple things:

The Delete function works, but throws an error after successfully removing the item in the DB. I threw my hands up on this one. 

I found a great deal of small typo's or missing identifiers in the react code, that prevented the UI from rendering in the browser. I was not sure if this was intentional or not, but if it was, it was a painful process of figuring out the error. It was every single route and process. However, it did motiviate me to learn about React. For me, this was the biggest chuck of time.

I would greatly appreciate any feedback on my code writing. I'm teaching myself how to program and it would be helpful if there are any tips for improvement.

Thank you.

10/8 
- Project did not work unless I removed all version dependencies from the requirements.txt file. Specifically Psycopg2-binary and Werkzeug were producing errors at the desired version


-Needed to alter trivia.psql to reflect a new Owner: postgres (my DB username).

10/10
- Compelted Get questions and Delete questions.
  - delete throws an error upon confirmation, but the change still persists in the DB. It is supposed to call getQuestions() on success, but there are no parameters passed, maybe I can fix this error by updating.

10/13 
-added pointer to Links for better UX (Header.css)
- FormView.js was throwing error - Category type needed to be added to form.
- Created search query. Needed to change url in QuestionView.js
- Get categories works. route misspelling corrected.

10/14
- QuizView.JS was missing categories[id].type.... 
- play quiz is working. Had create a random question method. \
- Updated all docstrings for clarity and updated error handlers.
